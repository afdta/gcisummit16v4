				<h2 class="reading">The world's largest metropolitan areas concentrate the drivers of global prosperity, but there isn't one way to be a global city—this report defines seven types of global cities, providing a valuable lens through which to understand an evolving global economy.</h2>
				
				<p class="reading"><b>As societies and economies around the world have urbanized, they have upended the classic notion of a global city.</b> No longer is the global economy driven by a select few major financial centers like New York, London, and Tokyo. Today, members of a vast and complex network of cities participate in international flows of goods, services, people, capital, and ideas, and thus make distinctive contributions to global growth and opportunity. And as the global economy continues to suffer from what the IMF terms “too slow growth for too long,” efforts to understand and enhance cities’ contributions to growth and prosperity become even more important.</p>

				<h2>Seven types of global cities</h2>
				<p class="reading">In view of these trends and challenges, this report redefines global cities. It introduces a new typology that builds from a first-of-its-kind database of dozens of indicators, standardized across the world’s 123 largest metro economies, to examine what really defines a global city—its economic characteristics, industrial structure, and key competitiveness factors: <b>tradable clusters, innovation, talent, and infrastructure connectivity</b>.</p>

				<p class="reading">The typology reveals that there is no one way to be a global city. Grouped into seven metropolitan clusters, the distinct competitive positions of the world’s largest metro economies become sharper, as do the peers metropolitan areas can look to for common solutions and investments to enhance economic growth.</p>

				<h2>A typology based on competitiveness factors [What to footnote?]</h2>
				<p class="reading">[Several sentences describing clustering, followed by a link to methods.]</p>
				<p class="reading"><b>Tradable Clusters</b>: Tradable industries are a critical driver of prosperity and competitiveness. These industries are typically anchored by globally engaged firms, which have valuable spillovers for local economies. The traded sector can be measured several ways. We measure tradable industries using data on Greenfield foreign direct investment, which is inextricably bound up with traded industry clusters, and the productivity differential (measured as output per worker) between a metro area’s traded sector and its nation’s traded sector.i Due to data limitations at the metropolitan scale, we are unable to standardize and measure domestic investments across industries or include data on global trade flows.</p> 
				<p class="reading"><b>Innovation</b>: A region’s innovative capacity and levels of entrepreneurship both have implications for its ability to develop and deploy commercial applications, start new businesses, and maintain industrial competitiveness in the face of disruptive technological change.ii We measure innovation through the scientific impact of research universities, patenting, and venture capital flows.</p>
				<p class="reading"><b>Talent</b>: Human capital, the stock of knowledge, skills, expertise, and capacities embedded in the labor force, is of critical importance to enhancing productivity, raising incomes, and driving economic growth. We measure talent through the share of population with tertiary education and, due to the contributions to labor markets that immigrant provide, the share of the population that is foreign-born.iv Data limitations prevent us from measuring the skills and competencies of the workforce. </p>
				<p class="reading"><b>Infrastructure Connectivity</b>: Infrastructure connectivity matters for regional competitiveness because firms rely upon global access, both physically and digitally, to participate in the efficiencies of global value chains. We measure infrastructure connectivity through aviation passenger flows and internet download speeds.v Due to data limitations we are unable to utilize standardized indicators on other important infrastructure metrics such as the quality of freight and logistics systems, roads, and public transit.</p>
